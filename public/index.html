                <h3>Web Servers</h3>
                <!-- Explain what index means as it relates to websites and servers. -->
                <p>
                    The <strong>index.html</strong> nomenclature is the industry-wide standard used for the
                    homepage of websites.
                    Websites are built inside a directory on a web server, and every page is saved as a
                    separate file.
                    The index.html is the web server's default page when no other page is specified
                    in the URL. It is best
                    practice to include a file called index.html in your directory, some other standard options
                    are default.html, home.html, or any file named index with a different extension.
                </p>
                <!-- Explain what you see in the browser's Web Dev/Inspector tools. What is different about the file's details on the web server versus the local computer? -->
                <p>
                    The difference between the file details of the web server and the local computer
                    are that the Request URLs are different.
                    The server request has the web address, while the local computer request URL is equivalent
                    to the file's location in the local computer.
                    Ultimately, the server request URL includes a remote address
                    and port.
                    There are two additional requests for the web server compared to the local computer; the
                    favicon.ico and the executor.js.
                    Request headers and response headers have many more parts for the web server; some of these in the
                    response headers are the Connection, Content-Encoding and Length, the E-tag and the type of server,
                    in this case, is Apache/2.4.6 (CentOS). The Request headers also have many more parts,
                    including the
                    accepted language, cookies, accepted encoding, acceptances, and others.
                </p>
                <!-- Explain why the favicon.ico file has a status 200, but the main.css and main.js files do not. -->
                <p>
                    The favicon.ico has a status of 200 because it sends a request to a different URL where
                    it finds the icon.
                    On the other hand, main.js and main.css are being requested to the same directory of the
                    HTML file, where they are not found (status code: 404) because there are no files named like that in
                    said
                    directory.
                </p>
                <!-- Explain the parts of the URL to your web file. What are the scheme, subdomain, host domain, and resources? -->
                <p>
                    The URL to this web file is the following: https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~steinhal/
                    <strong>
                        HTTPS
                    </strong>
                    is the scheme that identifies the protocol that must be used for the request. HTTPS is an
                    encrypted protocol.
                    <strong>
                        web.engr
                    </strong>
                    is the subdomain name
                    <strong>
                        oregonstate.edu
                    </strong>
                    is the domain name, which gets mapped by the DNS to an IP address where the request is sent.
                    <strong>
                        ~steinhal
                    </strong>
                    is the path to the resource. In this case, this is just a drive. Since the specific file is
                    not specified, the web server will look for a default file, in this case, index.html, and
                    return it.

                <h3>Frontend Design</h3>
                <!-- The concept of frontend design -->
                <p>
                    <strong>Frontend Design</strong> is the development of the graphical aspects of a website
                    or application.
                    It encompasses the page's visual design, the graphical user interface (GUI), and the user's
                    interactive
                    experience (Usability). Many elements compose the design of a website/app, from color schemes
                    to typography,
                    images, and more.
                    A good frontend design looks good, is easy to use, and it caters to the user group and brand
                    of the website.

                        interested in fill-in text.
                        This information needs to be as complete and clear as possible while, at the same time,
                        being accurate and up-to-date.

                    <dd>These goals need to be met quickly, with the fewest steps. This means that the information needs
                        to be found quickly, be understandable, concise, and best if it uses visuals to help convey it.
                        One of
                        the greatest factors of bad user experience is long response times. To mitigate the chance of
                        loosing a user,
                        it is recomended to use a wait/busy cursor for delays of 2 to 10 seconds, and progress bars for
                        longer.

                    <dd>The navigation is intuitive and allows users to locate their goals quickly. This means that the
                        navigation needs
                        to be clear. The product is constructed
                        in a way that supports initial and continued learning. One of the factors that contribute to bad
                        navigation are
                        content depth levels. As the number of levels a user has to go through to get to the content of
                        interest rises,
                        the ability for the user to navigate easily will decrease and so the likelihood of returning to
                        the website.

                        needs to be clear and unambiguous, in other words, not likely to be misunderstood.

                <!-- The purpose of page layout tags, in a <p> paragraph. -->
                <p>The purpose of <strong>page layout tags</strong> is that these tags help structure the web page so
                    that the
                    user can easily navigate through it. Although they do not add much style, and sometimes not at all,
                    layout
                    tags help users with visual organization and help machines distinguish different webpage areas. The
                    <strong>&lt;header&gt;</strong> is the banner of the page, and it is usually consistent throughout
                    the website
                    and displays the brand or logo of the organization.
                    <strong>&lt;nav&gt;</strong> wraps the navigational anchors and it can appear more than once on a
                    page. It
                    commonly consists of tabs for a desktop App and a dropdown menu for handheld ones.
                    The <strong>&lt;main&gt;</strong> element represents
                    the main block of content and encompasses all the other layout tags.
                    The <strong>&lt;section&gt;</strong> element is contained
                    within the &lt;main&gt; and groups content that has a main theme. It usually contains at least a
                    second-level headline and an article.
                    The <strong>&lt;article&gt;</strong> element wraps a single specific topic and a third-level
                    headline.
                    <strong>&lt;aside&gt;</strong>
                    and <strong>&lt;figure&gt;</strong> are used for side text and pictures, respectively.
                    <strong>&lt;footer&gt;</strong> typically holds legal and
                    contact information and, in some cases, critical links.
                    The <strong>&lt;div&gt;</strong> element is, instead, a general element
                    used as a placeholder for a future or to divide content that wouldn't make sense to wrap under a
                    different tag.

                <p>
                    <strong>Anchor tags</strong> &lt;a&gt; can create hyperlinks to other web pages or different
                    locations on
                    the same page. When anchor tags are used in navigation, they are contained in a nav tag and
                    displayed
                    either as a menu or tabs. On the other hand, when they are used as text anchors, they are often
                    contained in
                    paragraphs, lists, or tables, with their destination being another web page that builds upon the
                    paragraph's
                    topic.

                <p>
                    Images, in order to be optimized, need to meet certain specifications. They need to have a
                    <strong>descriptive file name</strong>. A descriptive file name helps improve SEO, so users
                    can find it. <strong>Small file size</strong> to attain the fastest load time. This also means
                    delivering high resolution images only to high resolution devices. <strong>Exact
                        dimensions</strong>,
                    utilizing larger pixels images for smaller pixels spaces only increases load time, it is necessary
                    to crop or reduce these in size. <strong>Correct file format</strong>, different file formats
                    are suited for different purposes, using the correct one will reduce load time. And, finally,
                    the <strong>color mode</strong>, using RGB versus indexed coloring.

                <p>
                    The most common file formats for images are .JPG and WebP for photography, which have good
                    compression.
                    While, on the other hand, .GIF, .PNG, and .SVG are used for line art.

                <p>
                    While semantic HTML gives basic structure to webpages, it is actually CSS
                    (Cascading Stylesheets) that defines
                    how the content is supposed to behave. We incorporate stylesheets in websites because they
                    can improve usability, readability, and give the webpage an engaging design.

                <p>
                    There are different ways you can incorporate stylesheets to your App.
                    <strong>Externally</strong> through the reference of an external .css file from the
                    &lt;link&gt; tag inside the &lt;head&gt; area of a website. This is by far the most
                    preferred method. You would use this method because it is the most efficient.
                    The other ways are done directly within the HTML and JavaScript files.
                    <strong>Embedded</strong> within a &lt;style&gt; tag.
                    <strong>Inline</strong> within the element we are styling.
                    In <strong>JavaScript template literals</strong> within a JavaScript function.
                    And, finally <strong>regular JavaScript</strong>, my directly manipulation of the

                <h3>Forms</h3>
                <!-- What are the 6 major goals of accessible forms? And why? -->
                <p>
                    There are six major goals for accessible forms, the first one being to
                    <strong>provide clear instructions</strong> above the form and in the labels, keeping
                    in mind that placeholder values are only helpful to users with vision.
                    <strong>Why</strong> is the data being gathered and <strong>which fields are required</strong>.
                    It is also important to set the <strong>first field to autofocus</strong>, so users don't have
                    to use a pointer to start filling the form out.
                    Add <strong>tab indexing</strong> to complex forms, so users know in which order to fill the
                    form fields.
                    Furthermore, the <strong>validation messages need to be screen readable</strong>, so the
                    visually impaired can correct the errors in their form.
                    These goals are essential to achieve because they ensure a minimum amount of accessibility,
                    which means that users with physical or mental disabilities can utilize them.
                </p>
                <!-- What are the major tags, their attributes, and their purposes?   -->
                <p>
                    The most significant tags of forms are the &lt;form&gt;, &lt;label&gt;, &lt;input&gt;, and the
                    &lt;textarea&gt; tags. The <strong>&lt;form&gt;</strong> is by far the most important, it
                    encompasses the entire form. Two of its main attributes are <strong>action</strong>, which
                    specifies, as a URL, where the request from the form should be sent; and the
                    <strong>method</strong>, which specifies the HTTP method to be used in the request sent when
                    the form is submitted.
                    The &lt;label&gt; tag is used by screen readers to describe which data will be needed.
                    It also increases the pointer's click area. The for attribute in the label needs to match
                    the form control's id, this could be avoided by nesting the form control inside the label
                    <strong>&lt;input&gt;</strong> and <strong>&lt;textarea&gt;</strong>
                    are used to collect the form's data. Thanks to its <strong>type</strong> attribute, the
                    &lt;input&gt; tag can accept many different kinds of data, from text to checkboxes, buttons,
                    and all sorts of dropdown menus. The <strong>name</strong> attribute is essential to the
                    &lt;input&gt; tag as it pairs up with the form's value when the form is submitted.
                    <strong>Required</strong> is also an important attribute for the &lt;input&gt; tag as the
                    form can't be submitted until this field is filled in.
                    For field that require multiple lines &lt;textarea&gt; is used. This tag has no unique attributes.

                <!-- What are the major form style recommendations to improve usability?  And why? -->
                <p>
                    There are many ways to improve form usability. One way is to use the additional
                    &lt;fieldset&gt; and &lt;legend&gt; tags to separate form controls into logical groups, not
                    only because it helps understand the group, but also because it improves accessibility to
                    the visually impaired.
                    Since many forms are filled via cellphone, the height and width of control elements should be 
                    at least the size of the tip of a finger. 
                    In order to not overwhelm the user and to make the form easier to understand, it is recommended
                    to display the labels as blocks.
                    Other styling changes will help the user's experience of filling out a form by seeing where they
                    are at and what is already completed. One of these styling changes is the <strong>autofocus</strong>
                    attribute for the &lt;input&gt; tag. This attributes places the user's cursor in, preferably, the 
                    first field to be filled, without the need to select it. Pointing out which fields are required is 
                    also very helpful.

                <p><strong>Node.js</strong>
                    is a runtime environment that allows us to run JavaScript outside the browser. 
                    This means that JavaScript can be used to develop server-side and networking applications. Node offers a great 
                    amount of JavaScript libraries which ease development. 
                </p> 
                <p><strong>NPM</strong>
                    stands for Node Package Manager, and it allows us to manage our Node packages. NPM 
                    makes it easy to download packages directly from the command line. Other things that NPM is useful for is creating
                    new node applications with a simple command <code style="color: black; background-color: #eeeeff;">npm init</code>. 
                    NPM contains over <link href="https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_npm.asp" 800,000 libraries> and it is used by open-source developers to share
                    software.
                </p> 
                <p><strong>Express.js</strong> is a framework for Node that allows us to manage HTTP requests at different URL paths.
                One of the great things about Express is that developers have created middleware packages to fix almost any problem.</p>
